# Active Context: Stentor Project

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-19

**Current Work Focus:**
The project is on the verge of its first public release. All development, feature implementation, and code hardening are complete. The sole remaining task is to analyze the results from the long-duration endurance test, which has been running to process a large, real-world audio backlog.

**Recent Achievements:**
*   Completed all final feature polish, including: automated cleanup of original source files, flexible Whisper model selection, and a full review of script timeouts.
*   Confirmed that the codebase is clean, with no remaining temporary files.
*   Prepared the project structure for a public release.
*   Successfully ran the system under a long-duration, real-world load, validating its stability and core design.

**Next Immediate Steps:**

1.  **Analyze Endurance Test Logs (Primary Task):**
    *   Review the logs from `queue_processor.sh` and `process_audio.sh` from the long-duration test.
    *   Extract key performance metrics: total audio processed, processing time vs. audio duration, resource usage patterns (if available).
    *   Identify any non-critical warnings or potential areas for future optimization. Document these findings for post-release consideration.

2.  **Final Documentation Polish (Pre-Flight Check):**
    *   Conduct a final, quick read-through of the `README.md` and the guides in the `/docs` directory to catch any typos or clarity issues.

3.  **Publish Release:**
    *   Once satisfied with the test analysis, push the repository to GitHub and create the initial public release.

**AI Assistant Instructions for This Session & Next:**
*   Be prepared to analyze extensive logs and performance data from the long-duration test.
*   Assist in summarizing the findings from the logs.
*   Assist with any final wording or polishing of the public-facing documentation.
*   Adhere to all project rules for the release process.
