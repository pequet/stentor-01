# Active Context: Stentor Project

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-29

**Current Work Focus:**
Following a significant refactoring of the core logging and messaging utilities and the creation of a new client-side installer, the immediate focus has shifted to **verifying the stability of the server-side scripts**. While the client-side components have been tested, the server-side audio processing pipeline is now in an untested state post-refactor. The previously planned public release is on hold until this verification is complete.

**Recent Achievements:**
*   Successfully refactored all scripts (client and server-side) to use a new, centralized `logging_utils.sh` and `messaging_utils.sh` for consistent output.
*   Created a comprehensive `install.sh` script to simplify the setup of all client-side dependencies and tools.
*   Confirmed through testing that the new installer and all refactored client-side scripts are working as expected.

**Next Immediate Steps:**

1.  **Test Server-Side Scripts (Primary Task):**
    *   Deploy the latest versions of `queue_processor.sh` and `process_audio.sh` (and their utils) to the Stentor droplet.
    *   Conduct a thorough test of the entire server-side audio processing pipeline.
    *   Monitor the logs closely for any errors or regressions introduced by the utility script refactoring.

2.  **Analyze Test Results:**
    *   If tests are successful, the project can return to its pre-release validation phase.
    *   If tests fail, diagnose and fix the issues in the server-side scripts.

3.  **Resume Release Plan (Post-Verification):**
    *   Once server-side stability is re-confirmed, the project will resume the final documentation polish and preparation for the initial public release.

**AI Assistant Instructions for This Session & Next:**
*   The primary focus is on ensuring the server-side scripts are functional.
*   Be prepared to analyze script logs from the Stentor droplet to identify potential errors.
*   Assist in debugging any shell script issues that may arise during testing.
*   Once testing is complete, be ready to pivot back to final documentation and release preparations.
