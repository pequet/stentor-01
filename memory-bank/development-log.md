# Development Log

## Session Ending 2025-06-05

**Focus:** Improving script robustness and user experience by refining lock-handling logic and command-line interfaces.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Enhanced Lock File Handling:**
    *   **Problem:** The `queue_processor.sh` script incorrectly moved files to the `failed/` directory when its child script, `process_audio.sh`, could not run due to an existing lock file. This was incorrect as a lock conflict is a temporary state, not a processing failure.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Modified `process_audio.sh` to exit with a new, specific exit code (`10`) when it encounters a lock file. This signals a "retryable" condition rather than a generic error. The script's header and changelog were updated to document this new exit code.
        *   Updated `queue_processor.sh` to recognize exit code `10`. When it detects this code, it now moves the corresponding files from the `processing/` directory back into the `inbox/`, ensuring they will be attempted again in the next run. This prevents files from being prematurely marked as failed.
        *   Additionally, the top-level `queue_processor.sh` was improved to exit gracefully with a success code (`0`) and an informational message if its own lock file is present, preventing the entire process from being flagged as an error.

2.  **Improved Script Usability:**
    *   Modified `queue_processor.sh` to require at least one command-line argument.
    *   If run with no arguments, or with a new `--help` flag, the script now prints a usage and options guide extracted directly from its own header comments. This makes the script's functionality easier to discover for the user.

**Key Learnings & Decisions:**
*   Using specific exit codes to differentiate between permanent failures and transient, retryable conditions (like lock contention) is crucial for building robust, self-healing automation pipelines.
*   Scripts intended for command-line use should provide clear help text when run without parameters or with a dedicated help flag.

**System State:**
*   The audio processing queue is now more resilient to temporary lock file conflicts.
*   The `queue_processor.sh` script is more user-friendly.

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue monitoring the long-duration test with the improved error-handling logic.

## Long-Duration Test Commenced 2025-06-04_1710

**Focus:** Initiating critical long-duration, full-queue, real-life system testing of the Stentor audio processing pipeline.

**Key Configuration & Goals:**
*   `queue_processor.sh` is now running in continuous mode to process the entire audio backlog (potentially months of content).
*   **Primary Model Strategy:** `small.en-q5_1` (or similar small quantized model) with `base.en-q5_1` (or similar base quantized model) as fallback.
*   **Aggressive Cleanup:** The `--aggressive-cleanup` flag is active to manage disk space.
*   **Objective:** Evaluate long-term system stability, resource utilization (CPU, RAM, disk), processing throughput, and overall reliability under sustained load.
*   This test is a crucial validation step before considering a public release of the Stentor-01 repository.

**Monitoring & Next Steps:**
*   System performance and logs will be closely monitored throughout the test.
*   Outcomes will be analyzed to identify any issues, performance bottlenecks, or areas for refinement.
*   Successful completion will pave the way for final public release preparations.

## Session Ending 2025-06-04 16:03:14

**Focus:** Live testing of the full audio processing pipeline, evaluating Whisper model performance on the droplet, and planning for backlog processing.

**Key Activities & Observations:**
*   Initiated testing with real-world audio content to assess the end-to-end pipeline.
*   **Medium Model (`medium.en-q5_0`) Performance:** Observed that while functional for very short segments, the medium model frequently times out or causes significant delays on longer segments within the current droplet's resource constraints. This makes it impractical for processing a large backlog efficiently.
*   **Revised Model Strategy for Backlog:** Decision made to prioritize `small.en-q5_1` followed by `base.en-q5_1` for the initial full queue processing run. The `medium.en-q5_0` model will be revisited if droplet resources are upgraded or for specific high-value content where its potential quality benefits outweigh speed concerns.
*   **Aggressive Cleanup Testing:** Successfully tested the `--aggressive-cleanup` feature, which correctly removes temporary processing directories.
*   **Mounting Stability:** File gathering and mounting (`sshfs`) seem generally stable during normal operation, though user noted some sketchiness with manual interruptions (Ctrl+C), which is a known edge case.
*   **Upcoming Full Queue Test:** Preparing to remove the "process one file only" limitation in `queue_processor.sh` to allow continuous processing of the entire backlog for an extended period (e.g., 12 hours) to observe long-term stability and throughput.

**Key Learnings & Decisions:**
*   The `medium.en-q5_0` model, in its current quantized form, is too resource-intensive for reliable, timely batch processing on the 1GB RAM droplet. Timeout issues lead to unacceptable delays.
*   Prioritizing `small.en-q5_1` -> `base.en-q5_1` is a more pragmatic approach for the initial backlog processing.
*   The variability in the number of silences in different audio sources significantly impacts segment length, which in turn affects which models are viable.
*   Dynamic model selection per segment/source is likely overly complex for the current stage; a consistent, reliable default sequence is preferred.

**System State:**
*   Core pipeline components (harvesting, queueing, processing, cleanup) are functional.
*   Parameters for `queue_processor.sh` (like `--models` and `--timeout-multiplier`) are configurable from the command line.
*   Model file existence is checked by `process_audio.sh` before use.

**Next Steps:**
*   User to conclude current test with medium model and aggressive cleanup.
*   Modify `queue_processor.sh` to remove the single-file processing limit.
*   Initiate a long-duration (e.g., 12-hour) test run on the full audio queue using the `small.en-q5_1`, `base.en-q5_1` model sequence.
*   Monitor system stability, resource usage, and processing throughput during this extended test.
*   Update state files (this activity).

## Session Ending 2025-05-29

**Focus:** Finalizing "Motivation Engine" integration, refining project journey tracking, and preparing to return to core Stentor functionality.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **"Motivation Engine" Integration Completed:**
    *   The conceptual framework for the "Motivation Engine" was discussed and its integration into project tracking was finalized.
    *   `memory-bank/project-journey.md` was updated to reflect this:
        *   Milestone **M01: Project Idea Defined & Motivation Engine Initialized** marked as `[x] (Completed: 2025-05-29)`.
        *   Milestone **M05: Framework/Ruleset Established** marked as `[x] (Completed: 2025-05-29)`.

2.  **Refinement of Rule `215-project-journey-tracking.mdc`:**
    *   The rule was substantially revised to be action-oriented, focusing on *how the AI should interact with and utilize* the `memory-bank/project-journey.md` file.
    *   Previous versions emphasizing structural verification of `project-journey.md` were removed.
    *   The updated rule now provides clear AI Interaction and Workflow Protocols for:
        *   Session Start: Reviewing Project Journey.
        *   Task & Milestone Alignment: Prompting updates and aligning tasks.
        *   Progress & Completion Updates: Reminding user to update Project Journey.
        *   Session End: Prompting review and update of Project Journey.
        *   Contextual Reference: Proactively referring to Project Journey.

3.  **Project Direction:**
    *   User confirmed completion of the "Motivation Engine" and related documentation/rule refinements.
    *   Explicit direction given to transition focus back to the primary Stentor project goals: YouTube playlist capture and audio transcription.

**Key Learnings & Decisions:**
*   AI rules should focus on actionable directives for the AI, rather than verification of static file structures if those structures are prerequisites for the AI's actions.
*   Direct and immediate execution of user requests is paramount (Reiteration of Rule 200).

**System State:**
*   `memory-bank/project-journey.md` accurately reflects current high-level project status.
*   Rule `.cursor/rules/215-project-journey-tracking.mdc` is updated to guide AI interaction effectively.
*   The "Motivation Engine" setup is considered complete.

**Next Steps (User Directed):**
*   Resume work on the Stentor project, focusing on YouTube playlist ingestion and transcription functionalities.
*   Update `memory-bank/active-context.md` to reflect this shift in focus.
*   Review `memory-bank/development-status.md`.

## Session Ending 2025-05-26_0338

**Focus:** Robust process interruption handling for `queue_processor.sh` and its child `process_audio.sh`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Identified Critical Flaw:** Interrupting `queue_processor.sh` (parent) previously left `process_audio.sh` (child) with a persistent lock file, causing a domino effect where all subsequent files were moved to `failed/` because `process_audio.sh` couldn't re-acquire its lock.
2.  **Iterative Solution Development:**
    *   **Stage 1 (Previous):** Implemented `LOCK_ACQUIRED_BY_THIS_PROCESS` flag in all relevant scripts (`queue_processor.sh`, `process_audio.sh`, `download_to_stentor.sh`, `periodic_harvester.sh`). This ensured a script only released a lock it definitively owned. While good, it didn't solve the parent-child interrupt problem on its own.
    *   **Stage 2 (This Session):** Modified `queue_processor.sh` to manage its child (`process_audio.sh`) PID:
        *   `process_audio.sh` is run in the background to get its PID, then `wait`ed for.
        *   The `trap` in `queue_processor.sh` (renamed `cleanup_queue_processor_and_child`) was enhanced to send `SIGTERM` to the `CHILD_PID` upon `queue_processor.sh` interruption.
    *   **Stage 3 (This Session - Refinement):** Further refined `queue_processor.sh`'s trap:
        *   Increased the wait time for the child (after `SIGTERM`) from 5 seconds to a more generous period (tested with 6s, user set to 120s, recommended 60s as a good balance) to allow `process_audio.sh` (which runs Whisper) adequate time to finish its current task and execute its own cleanup traps (which release its lock).
        *   Added a **safeguard**: If the child process is `SIGKILL`ed by `queue_processor.sh` (after the wait timeout), `queue_processor.sh` now checks if the `process_audio.lock` file's PID matches the `CHILD_PID` it just killed. If so, `queue_processor.sh` removes the child's lock file. This prevents stale locks even if the child is unresponsive.
3.  **Testing & Validation:**
    *   User confirmed that with the Stage 3 changes, interrupting `queue_processor.sh` now leads to the correct behavior: the in-progress file is moved to `failed/`, `process_audio.sh`'s lock is reliably cleared (either by itself or by the parent's safeguard), and subsequent runs of `queue_processor.sh` can process new files without issue. The domino effect is resolved.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created an inbox entry (`inbox/2025-05-26_0330-learnings-robust-process-interruption-handling.md`) detailing the problem, solution evolution, and key learnings regarding signal handling, lock management, and parent-child process interactions in shell scripts.

**Key Learnings & Decisions:**
*   Effective interrupt handling in parent-child shell script scenarios requires the parent to explicitly manage child PIDs and propagate termination signals.
*   Children should have their own robust traps and lock management (e.g., `LOCK_ACQUIRED_BY_THIS_PROCESS`) to clean up their resources when signaled.
*   Providing adequate time for a child process (especially one performing long operations like transcription) to respond to `SIGTERM` is crucial for graceful shutdown.
*   A parent-side safeguard to clean up a known child's specific resources (like a PID-verified lock file) after a forced `SIGKILL` adds an important layer of robustness.
*   Moving interrupted/failed files to a `failed/` directory for manual review is a safer default than automatic retries for unhandled interruption types.

**System State:**
*   The lock management and interruption handling for `queue_processor.sh` and `process_audio.sh` are now significantly more robust.

**Next Steps (Potential for Future):**
*   Further fine-tune the `wait_time` in `cleanup_queue_processor_and_child` if needed after more observation.
*   Consider strategies for files that might get legitimately stuck in `processing/` due to `process_audio.sh` crashing internally (not due to `queue_processor.sh` interruption), e.g., `queue_processor.sh` scanning `processing/` on startup for very old files. 

## Session Ending 2025-05-23_1813

### RESOLVED: Mount Point README File Creation Issue

**Problem**: The `STENTOR_MOUNT_README.md` file was not being created in mount point directories when using `download_to_stentor.sh`.

**Root Cause**: Logic order issue in `download_to_stentor.sh`:
1. Script created mount point directory 
2. Script called `mount_droplet_yt.sh`
3. Mount script saw directory already existed and skipped README creation

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Modified `mount_droplet_yt.sh`**: Added README creation logic when script creates new mount point directory
2. **Reordered `download_to_stentor.sh`**: Moved mount management (Section 5) before directory creation (Section 6)

**Result**: 
- Mount script now handles all mount point directory creation and README placement
- Download script delegates mount point creation entirely to mount script
- No duplication of directory creation logic
- README files will be created regardless of which script runs first

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/client-side/mount_droplet_yt.sh` - Added README creation
- `scripts/client-side/download_to_stentor.sh` - Reordered logic sections

**Key Learning**: When one script calls another for specialized tasks, the calling script should delegate responsibility entirely rather than partially handling the task.

# Development Log: Stentor Project

<!-- NEW LOG ENTRIES GO AT THE TOP - REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER -->

## Session Summary - 2025-05-23 04:08

**Key Activities & Decisions:**
- **`process_audio.sh` Refinements:**
    - Implemented a dynamic timeout mechanism for Whisper transcription. Timeout is now calculated based on segment duration, a configurable multiplier (`TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER`), and clamped by `MIN_SEGMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `MAX_SEGMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.
    - Enhanced error handling: The script now correctly manages `timeout` command exit codes when `set -e` is active, ensuring model fallback occurs as intended.
    - Added a critical failure condition: If all specified Whisper models fail to transcribe a segment, the script will now log a critical error and exit, preventing further processing on potentially problematic files.
    - Improved logging: The detailed markdown transcript (`audio_transcript.md`) now includes the specific Whisper model that successfully transcribed each segment in the segment header (e.g., `--- Segment 001 (Model: tiny.en) ---`).
    - Bug Fix: Corrected the `sed` command responsible for extracting the segment number, resolving an issue where segment numbers were appearing blank in logs and output files.
- **Observations on Model Behavior & Timeout Strategy:**
    - The choice of `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` significantly influences which models are ultimately used and the overall processing time. Lower multipliers (e.g., 5x) with a list of models (e.g., medium, small, base, tiny) often result in larger models timing out, leading to fallbacks. This can be slower due to retries but allows for potential quality gains if a better model succeeds within its calculated window.
    - Directly specifying a smaller, faster model (e.g., `small.en`) might be more time-efficient for certain use cases, though potentially at the cost of accuracy compared to larger models.
    - The `medium.en` model frequently times out unless a significantly larger timeout multiplier (e.g., >10x) or a very generous `MAX_SEGMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is provided.

**Learnings & Insights:**
- The dynamic timeout offers more flexibility but requires careful consideration of the multiplier and model list to balance speed and quality.
- User suggestion: Making `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` an optional command-line parameter for `process_audio.sh` would be a valuable enhancement for easier tuning and experimentation.

**Next Steps (from active-context.md):**
- Continue testing `process_audio.sh` with diverse audio inputs.
- Document the new dynamic timeout and model selection strategy.
- Explore implementing `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` as a command-line argument.

## Session Summary - 2025-05-23 04:24 (Follow-up)

**Key Activities & Decisions (Continued from previous 04:08 entry):**
- **`process_audio.sh` - Timeout Multiplier as CLI Argument & Logging:**
    - Successfully made the `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` an optional third command-line argument for `process_audio.sh`. This includes input validation for the provided multiplier.
    - The effective `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` used for the run is now logged in the main header of the `audio_transcript.md` file for better traceability.
- **Advanced Timeout Strategy & Model Performance Observations (User Insights):**
    - With a sufficiently generous `TIMEOUT_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` (e.g., 20x), larger models like `medium.en` can successfully transcribe segments, offering higher quality at the cost of longer processing time. This approach is effective because it prevents premature timeouts on the desired high-quality model, thus avoiding unnecessary fallbacks.
    - The choice of multiplier should ideally align with the processing requirements of the highest-quality model in the user-defined list.
    - The `MAX_SEGMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` acts as an important global cap, preventing runaway processing on problematic segments.
    - This configurability offers significant control: users can opt for a high-quality model with a high multiplier, or a faster model (like `small.en`) with a multiplier still generous enough to ensure its completion, providing a balance between speed and quality.

**Learnings & Insights:**
- The current `process_audio.sh` script has become quite robust and flexible regarding model selection and timeout management.
- The script is now well-positioned to be a core component in a larger, automated audio processing workflow.

**Refined Next Steps for `process_audio.sh` (Leading to Wrapper Script Development):**
1.  **Thorough Testing:** Conduct tests with longer, more representative audio files (e.g., 1-hour duration with typical ~2s silences for segmentation) to assess real-world performance and identify any new bottlenecks or issues.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Cleanup:** The script must clean up all its temporary files and potentially the entire run-specific directory upon successful completion. On failure, cleanup should be partial or skipped to allow for debugging.
3.  **Standardize Success/Failure Reporting:** `process_audio.sh` needs to:
    *   Use clear exit codes to signal overall success (0) or failure (non-zero).
    *   On success, provide a clear, easily parsable output indicating the path to the main transcript files (e.g., the `CURRENT_RUN_DIR` or direct paths to `audio_transcript.md` and `audio_transcript.txt`).
4.  **Develop Wrapper Script:** Design and create a new script that can:
    *   Manage a queue of audio files to be processed.
    *   Call `process_audio.sh` for each file.
    *   Interpret the success/failure signals from `process_audio.sh`.
    *   Implement retry logic (e.g., retry a failed job once, or with different parameters).
    *   Handle post-processing of successful transcriptions (e.g., moving files, calling other tools, uploading results).

## Session Summary - 2025-05-23 04:37 (Brainstorming Follow-up)

**Key Discussions & Insights:**
- **Resource Utilization on Stentor-01:**
    - Confirmed that high CPU (~95-100%) and memory (~100%) usage during `process_audio.sh` execution is acceptable and expected for a dedicated server, provided the system remains stable and jobs complete successfully. Load average around 1.0x on the 1vCPU is a good sign of efficient utilization.
    - Swap usage is likely and normal under these conditions.
    - Key stability indicators: job completion, system responsiveness (SSH access), and avoidance of excessive swap thrashing.
- **Audio Processing Queue Management Strategy:**
    - Brainstormed a simple and robust queue management system for `process_audio.sh`:
        1.  **Input:** A monitored "inbox" folder for new audio files.
        2.  **Queue Manager Script:** A separate script, triggered by cron (e.g., every minute).
        3.  **Locking:** Both the queue manager script AND `process_audio.sh` must implement robust lock file mechanisms (e.g., `mkdir` with `trap` for cleanup) to prevent concurrent execution.
        4.  **Processing:** Queue manager picks the oldest file, invokes `process_audio.sh`.
        5.  **Outcome Handling:** Based on `process_audio.sh`'s exit code (0 for success, non-zero for failure), the queue manager moves the original audio file to a "succeeded" or "failed" subfolder.
        6.  **`process_audio.sh` Requirements:** Needs to implement its own lock, provide clear exit codes, and output the path to results on success.
    - This approach is deemed suitable for the dedicated nature of the Stentor server, prioritizing simplicity and reliability over more complex queueing systems.

**Impact on Next Steps:**
- The immediate next steps for `process_audio.sh` are now clearly defined: implement robust cleanup, standardized success/failure reporting (exit codes, result path), and its own internal lock file mechanism.
- Following these enhancements to `process_audio.sh`, the development of the separate queue manager script can begin.

## Session Ending 2025-05-22

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Node.js and `vibe-tools` Installation & Testing (`docs/010-...`):
    *   Successfully re-verified and documented the installation of Node.js (LTS) and `npm`.
    *   Updated `npm` to the latest version.
    *   Installed `vibe-tools` globally.
    *   Configured `~/.vibe-tools/.env` with API keys.
    *   Diagnosed and resolved an issue with `vibe-tools repo` not seeing shell scripts due to missing `**/*.sh` in `repomix.config.json`. Added `**/*.sh` to the include list.
    *   Successfully tested `vibe-tools repo` with a query about `scripts/server-setup/` after the `repomix.config.json` fix.
    *   Successfully tested `vibe-tools ask` using the `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` model.
    *   Significantly updated `docs/010-installing-nodejs-and-vibe-tools.md` to be clearer, more actionable, and include these advanced `vibe-tools` usage examples (`repo`, `ask`) and notes on model selection and output saving.

2.  **Whisper.cpp & Stentor Droplet Performance Insights:**
    *   Noted the user's surprise and positive finding that even a quantized medium English model of Whisper.cpp could process a short sample on the 1GB RAM Stentor-01 droplet. This is a significant learning point for resource expectations.

3.  **Future Automation Potential Identified:**
    *   Discussed the significant potential for automating audio processing workflows by combining `vibe-tools` (for AI tasks), FFmpeg (for audio manipulation like format conversion, silence detection, chunking), and Whisper.cpp (for transcription).

4.  **Server Setup Progress:**
    *   Concluded that the foundational server setup (OS, hardening, Node.js, `vibe-tools`, FFmpeg, Whisper.cpp) is now largely complete and verified.

**Learnings & Decisions:**
*   The `repomix.config.json` `include` section is critical for `vibe-tools repo` to have correct context; it must explicitly list all relevant file type patterns (e.g., `**/*.sh`).
*   Using general model identifiers like `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` is more robust for documentation examples than highly specific dated versions.
*   The 1GB Stentor droplet shows promising capability with optimized Whisper.cpp models for short audio, exceeding initial expectations.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed to define and implement the audio processing workflow as outlined in `docs/030-stentor-audio-processing-workflow.md`.
*   Incorporate existing user scripts for audio processing into the project codebase.
*   Conduct further testing and measurement to determine the practical limits of the Stentor-01 droplet for the envisioned audio processing tasks.

    *   Extensive and very difficult session identifying and attempting to correct AI failures in diagnostics, assumption-checking, and adherence to existing rules (200, 250, 270).
    *   Created new rules `205-diagnostic-hierarchy-and-assumption-checking.mdc` and `206-direct-integration-of-verified-facts.mdc`.
    *   After multiple failed attempts by AI to make them concise, user manually ensured they were updated to be actionable and brief as per Rule 250.
    *   AI performance during this process was extremely poor, causing significant user frustration and highlighting critical areas for AI improvement.

**Session Challenges:**
*   AI repeatedly failed to follow instructions, made incorrect assumptions, and provided overly complex or incorrect solutions, particularly regarding file locations and script debugging. This led to significant delays and extreme user frustration.
*   AI had difficulty correctly editing its own rule files to be concise.

**End State:**
*   Stentor-01 server is provisioned.
*   Whisper.cpp is compiled, a default model is downloaded, and the installation script is functional.
*   Relevant documentation and AI rules have been updated (though the process was painful).
*   User is (understandably) extremely frustrated with AI performance.

## 2025-05-25: Droplet Specification Decisions

**Session Goal:** Finalize hardware specifications and OS choice for Stentor droplet.

**Activities:**
* Evaluated Linux distribution options (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux)
* Compared DigitalOcean droplet options: regular CPU/SSD ($6/mo), Premium AMD with NVMe SSD ($7/mo), Premium Intel with NVMe SSD ($8/mo)
* Analyzed the specific requirements for Whisper.cpp, audio file processing, and server reliability
* Discussed the implementation of swap space for added memory safety

**Decisions:**
* **OS Selection:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS chosen for its 5-year support window, stability, excellent software compatibility
* **Hardware Selection:** Premium AMD CPU with NVMe SSD ($7/mo) selected for best price-performance ratio
  * Premium CPU significantly improves transcription speed (Whisper.cpp is CPU-intensive)
  * NVMe SSD accelerates model loading and the audio processing pipeline (MP3→WAV conversion, silence detection, file splitting)
* **Swap Configuration:** 2GB swap space to be configured as safety net against OOM errors
  * Not intended as RAM replacement but as protection against memory spikes and emergency situations
  * Particularly important given the 1GB RAM constraint and memory-intensive processing

**Documentation Updates:**
* Updated `docs/000-stentor-droplet-provisioning-and-initial-setup.md` with detailed OS and hardware specifications
* Added swap space configuration steps with complete command sequence
* Added summary entries to `docs/040-stentor-key-decisions-and-learnings.md`

**Next Actions:**
* Provision the Stentor-01 droplet with the finalized specifications
* Implement the initial setup steps including swap space configuration
* Proceed with software installation (Node.js, vibe-tools, FFmpeg, whisper.cpp)

## 2025-05-24: Documentation Improvements & Environment Variables Implementation

**Session Goal:** Enhance documentation usability with environment variables for better copy-paste experience.

**Activities:**
*   Identified a usability issue with hardcoded placeholders in command blocks (e.g., `your_stentor_user`, `STENTOR_DROPLET_IP`) that required manual substitution.
*   Implemented a shell environment variable approach to improve command copy-paste experience.
*   Updated documentation files to use environment variables:
    *   Added an "Environment Variables Setup" section to `docs/000-stentor-droplet-provisioning-and-initial-setup.md` 
    *   Added a "Prerequisites: Environment Variables" section to `docs/030-stentor-audio-processing-workflow.md`
    *   Updated all command blocks to use `$STENTOR_USER` and `$STENTOR_IP` variables
*   Updated client-side scripts to use environment variables:
    *   Modified `scripts/client-side/mount_droplet_yt.sh` to read from `$STENTOR_USER` and `$STENTOR_IP`
    *   Added environment variable checks with helpful error messages
    *   Updated `scripts/client-side/unmount_droplet_yt.sh` for consistency
*   Added clear instructions for directory creation on the Stentor droplet (`yt_dlp_output` and `audio_uploads`)
*   Updated `memory-bank/tech-context.md` to document the environment variable approach

**Decisions:**
*   Standardized on `STENTOR_USER` and `STENTOR_IP` as the environment variable names.
*   All command blocks in documentation will use these variables for improved copy-paste experience.
*   Client-side scripts will now check for and use these environment variables.
*   Added verification commands (`echo`) after setting variables to help users confirm values.

**Next Actions (for User):**
*   Provision the actual `Stentor-01` droplet.
*   Set the environment variables as documented.
*   Follow the updated step-by-step instructions in the documentation.
*   Test the client-side scripts with the environment variables approach.

**Benefits of this Approach:**
*   Improved copy-paste experience: Users can directly copy and run commands without manual edits.
*   Consistency: The same variables are used throughout all documentation and scripts.
*   Error prevention: Scripts now check if variables are set and provide helpful error messages.
*   Flexibility: Users can easily change server details by updating environment variables without modifying scripts.

## 2025-05-23: Documentation Overhaul & `vibe-tools` Test Validation

**Session Goal:** Refine Stentor project documentation, validate `vibe-tools` installation procedure, and prepare for actual Stentor droplet setup.

**Activities:**
*   Reviewed and confirmed the standalone installation process for `vibe-tools` and its prerequisites (Node.js LTS, npm) based on user's successful test on a throwaway server.
*   Identified the need for a more structured documentation approach beyond a single `README.md` file.
*   Created a `docs/` directory and populated it with specific, numbered Markdown files covering:
    *   `000-stentor-droplet-provisioning-and-initial-setup.md`
    *   `010-installing-nodejs-and-vibe-tools.md`
    *   `020-installing-ffmpeg-and-whisper-cpp.md`
    *   `030-stentor-audio-processing-workflow.md`
    *   `040-stentor-key-decisions-and-learnings.md`
*   Migrated relevant content from `README.md` into these new structured documents.
*   Updated `README.md` to serve as a high-level overview, linking to the new detailed guides.
*   Refined content within the new `docs/` files:
    *   Corrected information in `docs/040-stentor-key-decisions-and-learnings.md` regarding `whisper.cpp` model performance (specifically `base.en-q5_1`) on 1GB RAM and highlighted the necessity of audio segmentation for longer files.
    *   Updated `docs/020-installing-ffmpeg-and-whisper-cpp.md` to instruct users to list available Whisper models before downloading specific ones.
*   Addressed documentation formatting for better usability:
    *   Created a new rule `.cursor/rules/255-codeblock-formatting.mdc` to enforce unindented, readable code blocks for copy-pastable content (shell commands, config examples like `stentor.conf`).
    *   Applied this formatting (unindenting and adding surrounding line breaks) to code blocks in the new `docs/` files.
*   Discussed the strategy for using placeholder usernames (e.g., `stentor_user`) in documentation versus actual usernames.

**Decisions:**
*   Adopted a multi-file documentation structure within a `docs/` directory for better organization and scalability.
*   Standardized on numbered file prefixes for documentation guides to indicate sequence.
*   Established a new rule (`255-codeblock-formatting.mdc`) for consistent code block presentation.
*   Confirmed the necessity of audio segmentation for processing long audio files with certain Whisper models on 1GB RAM.
*   The user will use a consistent placeholder (e.g., `your_stentor_user` or `stentor_user`) in documentation and substitute it with their actual chosen username during the Stentor droplet setup.

**Next Actions (for User):**
*   Provision the actual `Stentor-01` droplet.
*   Systematically follow the new documentation in the `docs/` directory to set up the server, install software (Node.js, `vibe-tools`, FFmpeg, `whisper.cpp`), and configure it.
*   Verify each step during the live setup and note any discrepancies or areas for documentation improvement.

**Open Questions for Next Session:**
*   Formalize the exact placeholder username (e.g., `stentor_user`) to ensure consistency across all documentation if current usage is varied.
*   Selection of initial `whisper.cpp` model for audio segmentation script development.
*   Consideration of any additional essential utilities for the Stentor droplet.

## 2025-05-22: Planning Review & Next Steps Refinement

### Activities
- Reviewed the initial plan generated by `vibe-tools plan` (see `inbox/2025-05-22_0100-vibetools-plan-stentor-initial-phase.md`).
- Discussed immediate next steps and project workflow.

### Decisions
- Before proceeding with the main Stentor droplet setup as outlined in the `vibe-tools plan` output, a preliminary test will be conducted by the user on a separate, throwaway DigitalOcean droplet.
- **Objective of Test:** Verify that `vibe-tools` can be installed (`sudo npm install -g vibe-tools`) and run as a standalone CLI tool globally on a server environment, independent of the Cursor IDE. This is to mitigate risks related to potential undocumented dependencies on the Cursor environment.
- The `scripts/client-side/` directory will house utility scripts run on the client machine, not on Stentor itself. Documentation updated to reflect this.

### Next Actions
- User to perform the `vibe-tools` standalone installation test on a throwaway droplet.
- Update `README.md` and Memory Bank with the findings of this test.
- Proceed with Phase 1 of the Stentor setup (server provisioning, hardening, etc.) once `vibe-tools` standalone functionality is confirmed and documented.

## 2025-05-21: Project Initialization

### Activities
- Created initial documentation in `README.md` outlining the setup plan for the Stentor droplet
- Created Memory Bank files to formalize project requirements and technical decisions
- Established core technologies and server specifications
- Identified key workflows and potential challenges

### Decisions
- Selected DigitalOcean as the hosting provider for the Stentor droplet
- Decided on a 1GB RAM / 1 vCPU / 25GB SSD initial specification
- Chose `whisper.cpp` with `tiny.en` and `base.en-q5_1` models for audio transcription
- Selected `sshfs` as the preferred method for audio file transfer
- Determined that `yt-dlp` must run on a local/non-data-center IP to avoid blacklisting

### Findings
- DigitalOcean droplet at the 1GB RAM tier should be sufficient for running Whisper.cpp with the selected models
- Larger Whisper models (e.g., `small.en` variants) will likely cause Out Of Memory errors
- Resource-intensive Vibe Tools commands may need to be limited on the 1GB RAM droplet

### Next Actions
- Enhance `README.md` with complete setup instructions
- Create scripts for `sshfs` mounting/unmounting
- Develop audio segmentation script for processing audio files
- Set up the Stentor droplet according to the documented plan
