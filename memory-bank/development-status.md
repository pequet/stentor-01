# Development Status

## Overall Status
The Stentor project has just completed a **major refactoring phase** to standardize logging and messaging utilities and to introduce a client-side installer. The client-side components have been tested and are stable. However, this has introduced a new, temporary risk, as the server-side scripts are now in an **unverified state**. The project's readiness for public release is now contingent on the successful validation of the entire server-side audio processing pipeline.

## Current Focus
The immediate focus is on **testing and verifying the refactored server-side scripts** (`queue_processor.sh`, `process_audio.sh`) on the Stentor droplet to ensure no regressions were introduced.

## Key Completed Milestones
- **Completed major refactor** of all scripts to use centralized logging and messaging utilities.
- **Created a new `install.sh` script**, significantly simplifying the client-side setup process.
- Development of a robust, interrupt-resilient queue processing system.
- Implementation of a full-featured client-side script for audio acquisition and transfer (`yt-dlp` + `sshfs`).
- Creation of a detailed, multi-part documentation suite for server provisioning and setup.

## Next Steps

1.  **Test Server-Side Scripts:** This is the primary blocker. The entire server-side workflow must be tested to validate the recent changes.

2.  **Remediate if Necessary:** If testing reveals issues, they must be diagnosed and fixed.

3.  **Return to Release Path:** Once the server-side scripts are confirmed to be stable, the project will return to its final validation phase, which includes a final documentation review and publication.
