# Development Status

## Overall Status
The Stentor project is in its **final validation phase** and is ready for its initial public release, pending analysis of a real-world endurance test. The core functionality is complete and has been significantly hardened. The project consists of a sophisticated suite of shell scripts for a robust, automated audio transcription pipeline, and comprehensive documentation that allows a technical user to replicate the entire server setup.

## Current Focus
The immediate focus is on **analyzing the logs and performance data** from the ongoing long-duration, real-world endurance test of the complete audio processing pipeline (`queue_processor.sh`). This analysis will provide the final confirmation of the system's long-term stability and efficiency.

## Key Completed Milestones
- Development of a robust, interrupt-resilient queue processing system.
- Implementation of a full-featured client-side script for audio acquisition and transfer (`yt-dlp` + `sshfs`).
- Complete implementation of error handling, lock management, automated cleanup (including original source files), flexible model selection, and production-ready timeouts.
- Creation of a detailed, multi-part documentation suite for server provisioning and setup.
- Successful completion of all development and feature polish.

## Next Steps

1.  **Analyze Endurance Test Results:** The primary and only remaining task before publication is to complete the analysis of the long-duration test for any final insights into stability and performance.

2.  **Final Documentation Review:** Conduct a final, rapid review of the user-facing documentation (`README.md` and `/docs`) to ensure it's polished for release. This is not a blocker.

3.  **Publish to GitHub:** Upon satisfactory review of the test results, publish the repository.
