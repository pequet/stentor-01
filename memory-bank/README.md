# About This Directory: The Project's Memory Bank

This directory contains the **Memory Bank** for the project. It is the complete log of its development history, design decisions, and evolution.

**This directory is not required to use the project's scripts.** The stable, usable product can be found in the `/scripts` directory.

## Why is this here?

Three main reasons:

1.  **Shows the "Why":** The memory-bank is a complete history of the project's evolution. It documents not just what was built, but why it was built that way. This is valuable context for anyone who truly wants to understand or contribute to the project.
2.  **Radical Transparency:** It's an honest, transparent look at the real process of software development, including the challenges and collaborative course-corrections made with an AI development partner.
3.  **It's Part of the "Product":** This project is not just a set of scripts, but a system of development where you and an AI collaborate. The memory-bank is a tangible artifact of that system.

Think of it as the project's "making-of" documentary. Feel free to explore if you're curious, but if you're just here to use the tool, you can safely focus on the main `README.md` and the `/scripts` directory.
