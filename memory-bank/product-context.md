# Product Context: Stentor

## Problem

Setting up and configuring a server environment for specialized tasks like audio transcription (Whisper.cpp) and AI automation (Vibe Tools) can be complex and time-consuming. If the setup is not well-documented, it becomes difficult to replicate, leading to inconsistencies and potential issues when creating redundant or similar server instances.

## Solution

The Stentor project aims to create a clearly defined, step-by-step documented process for provisioning and configuring a DigitalOcean droplet. This droplet will serve as a dedicated environment for Whisper.cpp, custom audio processing scripts, and Vibe Tools.

## User Experience Goals

The primary goal is to have a server that reliably performs audio transcription and hosts Vibe Tools. A critical secondary goal is to have documentation so clear and complete that the server setup can be easily and accurately replicated by another technical user, ensuring consistency and saving time for future deployments.
